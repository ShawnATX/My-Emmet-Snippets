# My-Emmet-Snippets
My custom Emmet snippets and abbreviations for VS code

##How to setup:

Save the repo or simply the snippets.json file. Remember the directory that you have saved this file (maybe copy the folder path in your address bar)

In VS Code you will navigate to File >> Preferences >> Settings >> Extensions >> Emmet >> Extension Path, then you will enter the path to locate your snippets.json file.


##How to Use:

These snippets work similarly to other Emmet abbreviations, you will begin typing the abbreviation and then tap Tab (on PC) to expand.

Available abbreviations:

**bootstrap** - This will add the Bootstrap stylesheet CDN link.


**html:bootstrap** - This is similar to the html:5 abbreviation, but includes Bootstrap CSS and JS links in the head and body.
